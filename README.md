# ü§ñ Line Follower Robot using Infrared Sensors and ROS

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Line Follower Robot** that uses **infrared (IR) sensors** to detect a black line on the floor and follow it autonomously.  
The robot is simulated using **ROS (Robot Operating System)** and can be extended to real-world applications.

The system uses **IR sensors** for line detection and a control algorithm to adjust motor speeds to keep the robot on track.

## üß© System Components
1. **Infrared Sensors**  
   - Detect line color contrast (black line on white surface)  
   - Provide digital signals (0/1) to the controller  

2. **Microcontroller / ROS Node**  
   - Reads sensor input  
   - Computes motor commands using control logic (e.g., PID or simple if-else)  

3. **Motors (Differential Drive)**  
   - Adjust speed of left and right wheels to follow the line  

4. **Simulation Environment**  
   - Gazebo or RViz for 3D simulation  
   - ROS nodes to process sensor data and send velocity commands

## üî¨ Methodology
1. **Line Detection**  
   - IR sensors detect black line vs white background.  
   - Left, center, and right sensors allow detection of line position.  

2. **Control Algorithm**  
   - If the line is under the center sensor ‚Üí move forward.  
   - If the line is under the left sensor ‚Üí turn left.  
   - If the line is under the right sensor ‚Üí turn right.  
   - If no line detected ‚Üí stop or search for the line.  

3. **ROS Integration**  
   - **Publisher Node:** Sends motor commands (`/cmd_vel`)  
   - **Subscriber Node:** Reads IR sensor data (`/ir_sensor`)  
   - Simulation loop updates robot motion based on sensor feedback.

## üìú Simulation Steps
1. Install **ROS (Noetic / Melodic recommended)**.  
2. Set up a **ROS workspace**.  
3. Create a **robot model** (URDF or differential drive model).  
4. Write ROS nodes for **sensor reading** and **motor control**.  
5. Launch simulation in **Gazebo** with a line track.  
6. Observe robot following the line in real-time.
